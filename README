This app is an example of a complex master-detail app that opens on a singlescreen, and can go several levels deep for some of the items in the list. 
It is the Alloy version of my Bananas app. 

As this is an open source project, I may not have time to update this often. 
But please feel free to fork from this project and make your own improvements. 
If you do so, I'd love to hear from you (and so would the rest of my blog readers, as this would help everyone! :) )
